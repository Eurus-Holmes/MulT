> Pytorch implementation for the paper "[Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00295.pdf)".

## Datasets

 - Data files (containing processed MOSI, MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets) can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hyzpgx1hp9nj37s/AAB7FhBqJOFDw2hEyvv2ZXHxa?dl=0).

 - To retrieve the meta information and the raw data, please refer to the [SDK for these datasets](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK).


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6
- [Pytorch (>=1.0.0) and torchvision](https://pytorch.org/)
- CUDA 10.0 or above


## Run the Code

1. Create (empty) folders for data and pre-trained models:
~~~~
mkdir data pre_trained_models
~~~~

and put the downloaded data in 'data/'.

2. Command as follows
~~~~
python main.py [--FLAGS]
~~~~

Note that the defualt arguments are for unaligned version of MOSEI. For other datasets, please refer to Supplmentary.

### If Using CTC

Transformer requires no CTC module. However, as we describe in the paper, CTC module offers an alternative to applying other kinds of sequence models (e.g., recurrent architectures) to unaligned multimodal streams.

If you want to use the CTC module, plesase install warp-ctc from [here](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc).

The quick version:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc.git
cd warp-ctc
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ../pytorch_binding
python setup.py install
export WARP_CTC_PATH=/home/xxx/warp-ctc/build
~~~~

Some portion of the code were adapted from the [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) repo.
